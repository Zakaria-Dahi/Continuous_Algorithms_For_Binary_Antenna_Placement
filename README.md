# Continuous_Algorithms_For_Solving_Binary_Problems (I)

**Programmer:shipit:**: Zakaria Abdelmoiz DAHI, University of Malaga, Spain. 

**About:** This repositiory implements the binary variants of the algorithms devised and studied in [1] that solves the antenna positioning problem in cellular networks using several types of antennas, named directive, directional and circular.

**How: :green_book:** 

    - To excuted just navigate to the folder BBAs or GGA.
    - Choose the folder of the variant you want to test `BA_Angle_modulation, ...
    - Excute the main.py file.
    - **NB**: I am using a cluster for my experiments, so if you are using a local machine just uncomment the lines I dedicated to it.

    - Code:
        - BBAs: contains seven binary variants of the bat algorithm:
            - Angle Modulation.
            - Grate value priority.
            - Normalised.
            - Quantum-inspired.
            - Rounding.
            - Sigmoid.
        - GGAs: Implements the generational genetic algorithm.
    - Results:
        - SQUARED_SHAPED_ANTENNA: results using squared antennas.
        - DIRECTIVE_SHAPED_ANTENNA: results using directive antennas.
        - CIRCLE_SHAPED_ANTENNA: results using circular antennas.
